    "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance occurs when a magnetic nucleus (e.g. hydrogen) is placed in an external magnetic field. Using a classical physics model, the nucleus can be thought of as a tiny bar magnet with an orientation and strength represented by its magnetic moment, written as $\\vec\\mu$. Nuclei with nonzero magnetic moment also have angular momentum, so it can also be thought of as a spinning top with the magnetic axis oriented in the same direction as the rotation axis (see the diagram on the right). When placed in an external magnetic field, which we will call $\\vec B_0$, the nucleus will experience a torque pulling it into alignment with $\\vec B_0$. However, because the nucleus also has angular momentum it will not rotate directly into alignment, but instead it will precess around $\\vec B_0$; behaving like a spinning top that is gradually falling over.\n",

Run the **Autoshim** tool below with the **Coarse** setting to shim the system. The *Coarse* setting will start by resetting all the shims to zero and uses a wide bandwidth, whereas the *Quick* setting loads the saved values and uses a narrow bandwidth; it is suitable for retuning the system once everything is set up. The shims will be saved to `shims.yaml` in your `LAB_DIR`, to be used by the FID experiment above.\n",
