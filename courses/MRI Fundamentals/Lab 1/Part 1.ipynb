    "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance occurs when a magnetic nucleus (e.g. hydrogen) is placed in an external magnetic field. Using a classical physics model, the nucleus can be thought of as a tiny bar magnet with an orientation and strength represented by its magnetic moment, written as $\\vec\\mu$. Nuclei with nonzero magnetic moment also have angular momentum, so it can also be thought of as a spinning top with the magnetic axis oriented in the same direction as the rotation axis (see the diagram on the right). When placed in an external magnetic field, which we will call $\\vec B_0$, the nucleus will experience a torque pulling it into alignment with $\\vec B_0$. However, because the nucleus also has angular momentum it will not rotate directly into alignment, but instead it will precess around $\\vec B_0$; behaving like a spinning top that is gradually falling over.\n",
