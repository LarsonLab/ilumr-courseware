    "- **How the precession frequency at different locations is affected during a magnetic field gradient**\n",
    "  - The precession frequency will have an offset proportional to the coordinate along the gradient axis\n",
    "- **How the precession phase at different locations is affected after a gradient pulse**\n",
    "  - The precession phase will be shifted by an amount proportional to the area under the gradient pulse and the coordinate along the gradient axis\n",
    "- **How frequency encoding allows position to be measured**\n",
    "  - By taking the fourier transform of the signal acquired with a gradient active, the coordinate along gradient axis can be calculated from the frequency offset and gradient amplitude\n",
    "- **How phase encoding allows position to be measured**\n",
    "  - Applying a gradient pulse before acquisition allows measuring a single spatial frequency.\n",

    "- **How the k-space spectrum relates to the image**\n",
    "  - K-space is the fourier transform of cartesian coordinate space. Coordinates in k-space are spatial frequencies, and the value at a coordinate tells you how well the image matches a sinewave with that wavelength (inverse of spatial frequency) and direction.\n",
    "- **How the k-space coordinate of a discrete signal sample is determined from the gradient pulse sequence**\n",
    "  - Each k-space coordinate of a sample is proportional to the area under the gradient applied along that coordinate axis between the excitation (RF 90 pulse) and the acquisition of that sample.\n",
    "- **What (in k-space, and in the pulse sequence) determines the field of view/zoom of the image**\n",
    "  - Field of View is determined by the spacing between samples in k-space, which is determined by the difference in area under the gradient pulses of two successive samples.\n",
    "    A larger spacing results in a smaller field of view.\n",
    "    For frequency encoding the k-space spacing is the gradient amplitude multiplied by the dwell time, and for phase encoding it is the gradient step size multiplied by the phase gradient duration.\n",
    "- **What (in k-space, and in the pulse sequence) determines the spatial resolution of the image**\n",
    "  - Spatial resolution is determined by the extent of the k-space spectrum. \n",
    "    Sampling a larger region of k-space results in a smaller (in meters, i.e. better) spatial resolution. \n",
    "    For frequency encoding the size of k-space is the gradient amplitude multiplied by the total acquisition time, and for phase encoding it is the area under the maximum gradient pulse.\n",

    "Part of Lab 1 involved optimising the duration of the NMR signal by correcting the magnetic field inhomogeneities (unevenness) using shims. Inhomogeneity caused nuclei at different locations in the sample to resonate at slightly different frequencies, causing destructive interference and reduction in signal. The fundamental principle of NMR imaging is to exploit the effect of inhomogeneity to locate the source of an NMR signal in space. To purposely distort the field in a way that is simple to analyse, we will use combinations of coils that create linear **gradients** in the the field strength along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes.\n",

    "Illustrations of these coils are shown in Figure 1.1 on the right (TODO).\n",

    "## 2. Frequency Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiments in **Task 1.1** showed how the frequency of the NMR signal from a small sample varies with position when a gradient is applied by offsetting a shim value. In fact, with calibration to determine the value of $G_z$, the frequency could be measured and the position calculated by rearranging Equation 1.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a sample made up of multiple small partitions of fluid; each partition will emit a signal with frequency depending on its position, but the measured signal will be the sum of all of them, a complex shape caused by constructive and destructive intereference. The frequencies present in the measured signal can be extracted using a Fourier Transform, revealing individual peaks associated with the partitions (See Figure 2.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact for any shape of sample in a field with a linear gradient, you can imagine slicing it along the gradient axis, summing the signals from the slices, and taking the Fourier Transform to obtain a measurement of the amount of nuclei in each slice. This results in a 1D projection image of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three important characteristics of this image are:\n",
    "- **Field of View (FOV)**: The physical size of the image, i.e. the size of the largest object that can be viewed without being cropped or wrapped.\n",
    "- **Spatial Resolution**: The level of detail, usually expressed as a minimum distance between features such that they are still resolved, and not merging into a single blob. Note that this is not the same as the number of pixels in the image (Pixel Resolution). e.g. a spatial resolution of 1 mm is *better resolution* than a spatial resolution of 2 mm.\n",
    "- **Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)**: The ratio of the amplitude of the signal in areas of image corresponding to the nuclei in the sample to the amplitude of the noise in areas without signal. A larger SNR is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, the shim values and gradient values are generally set seperately and added together by the hardware. The gradient also does not need to be active for the entire pulse sequence, only during the acquisition time and for a short time between the $90^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$ RF pulses – to satisfy a requirement for optimal spin echo formation where the area under the gradient between the $90^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$ pulses must match the area under the gradient from the $180^\\circ$ to the echo time ($T_E$).

    "The signal we acquire must generally be Fourier transformed to produce an image, and in order to understand how the pulse sequence and acquisition samples relate to the image obtained it is helpful to use the concept of *k*-space. A *k*-space image is the inverse Fourier transform of the image in physical space (the \"normal\" image). The value of a pixel in a *k*-space image represents the amount of a particular *spatial frequency* (units of radians per meter) in the physical space image, with the centre of *k*-space corresponding to low spatial frequencies and the edges to high spatial frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every discrete sample acquired during the pulse sequences has a *k*-space coordinate depending on the gradients and RF pulses applied so far. For frequency encoding as used in **Section 2**, $k_z$ evolves as shown in Figure 4.1 (A). The $180^\\circ$ RF pulse inverts the accumulated phase of nuclei that were excited by the initial $90^\\circ$ pulse, which also inverts the *k*-space coordinate. The pulse sequences is designed so that at the beginning of sampling $k_z$ is negative and passes through zero at $T_E$ before becoming positive. In this way we sample along a line segment through *k*-space centred at $k_z=0$, see Figure 4.1 (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling along a line segment in *k*-space produces a 1D image projected onto a line segment in physical space, and in **Section 3** it was possible to build a rough 2D image by combining multiple 1D projections. In *k*-space, the data acquired lies on line segments through the centre of 2D k-space as shown in Figure 4.2. In principle, instead of processing each line individually with a 1D Fourier transform, we can generalise and apply a 2D Fourier transform to our 2D *k*-space data. In practice this is difficult to do with the data from these line segments because they do not fall in a regular grid, and the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm cannot be used directly. There are advanced data processing techniques that can resample the data into a grid, but these will not be covered in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will modify the pulse sequence to cause the *k*-space coordinates to fall into a regular grid. This is done using *phase encoding*, where a gradient pulse is applied before sampling, causing the accumulated phase of precession to change depending on position. After a $y$ gradient pulse with amplitude $G_y$ and duration $t_y$ the final phase at coordinate $y$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\phi = \\bar\\gamma \\cdot G_y t_y \\cdot y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the $y$ position could be determined from the phase of the signal of a small partition of sample. With a large sample the signals from different $y$ locations will sum together into a single phase and magnitude, so multiple acquisitions stepping through values of $G_y t_y$ are required to fill the *k*-space grid as shown in Figure 4.3.\n",
